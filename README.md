- 👋 Hi, I’m @VictorS10
- 👀 I’m interested in anything related to robotics (mainly biped walking gaits), data science and machine learning
- I like programming but last 10 years I just coded in Matlab, so I want to get involved in other languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and R to develop machine learning algorithms 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone interested in these fields
